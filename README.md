# EdinActivitiesSearcherScript
A self-taught project to learn more about Web content, Scripts, Regular Expressions (Regex).

This script searches, shows, sends an email and generates a html file with the results of a specific searching in a website related to courses or activities. 
Users can select different searching criteria such as "keywords" or "time of day", or directly specify a url.

The script uses Regex to get and clean the information.

**Notes:**
 
- Using System.Net.Mail and System.Text.RegularExpressions.
- The user can select the criterian searching in the "ConfigKeys" method or directly assign a value to "url" value.

**Improvements:**

- Use Html Agility Pack
- Create DB to compare results

**Working with Unit Test** in the master branch
